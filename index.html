    <h2>🌌 Surprising Truths That Are Actually True</h2>

    <h3>✅ Truth 1: You are made of stars</h3>
    <p>
      It might sound impossible, but it’s scientifically true — the carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and iron in your body were all created in the hearts of <strong>exploding stars</strong> called supernovas. 🌠
    </p>
    <p>
      That means you — yes, you — are made of <span class="highlight">stardust</span>. 💫
    </p>
    <h4>🧪 Scientific Explanation:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Hydrogen</strong> and <strong>helium</strong> came from the Big Bang. Heavier elements like carbon and iron formed in stars.</li>
      <li>Massive stars go supernova, scattering these elements across space.</li>
      <li>Earth — and life — formed from this scattered stardust.</li>
      <li>Astrophysicists like <strong>Carl Sagan</strong> and <strong>Neil deGrasse Tyson</strong> confirm this with cosmology and atomic science.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>❌ Myth Busted: Humans only have 5 senses</h3>
    <p>
      Most people think we only have sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch. But science tells us we have <strong>at least 9–20 senses</strong>!
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Proprioception</strong> – sense of body position; proven by muscle and joint sensors (proprioceptors) and cerebellum processing.</li>
      <li><strong>Equilibrioception</strong> – balance sense; controlled by the vestibular system in the inner ear.</li>
      <li><strong>Thermoception</strong> – ability to sense heat and cold via thermoreceptors.</li>
      <li><strong>Nociception</strong> – pain detection using specialized sensory neurons called nociceptors.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Modern neuroscience textbooks and research from institutions like <strong>Harvard Medical School</strong> and the <strong>NIH</strong> support this.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the “5 senses” idea? That’s a <span class="highlight">myth</span>! ❌

    <h2>🥚 Did the Egg Come First, or the Hen?</h2>
    <p><strong>Ah — the classic riddle of biology and philosophy:</strong></p>
    <blockquote>
      🥚 <strong>Did the egg come first, or the hen?</strong>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>🧪 From a Scientific View:</h3>
    <h4>✅ The egg came first.</h4>
    <p>
      Here’s why:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Long before chickens existed, there were <strong>pre-chickens</strong> — birds very similar to modern hens.</li>
      <li>At some point, due to <strong>genetic mutation</strong>, two of these pre-chickens mated…</li>
      <li>…and <strong>the first true chicken</strong> was born from their egg.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      So the <strong>egg that hatched the first hen</strong> came from a bird that wasn’t quite a hen.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      ✅ <strong>Egg came before hen</strong> — evolution did it!
    </blockquote>
    <p>📚 This is backed by <strong>evolutionary biology</strong> and DNA studies.</p>

    <h3>🧠 From a Philosophical View:</h3>
    <p>It depends how you define:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>“Egg”: Any egg? Then <strong>eggs existed for millions of years</strong> before hens — fish and reptiles laid eggs long before birds evolved.</li>
      <li>“Chicken egg”: An egg <em>laid by a chicken</em>? Then the <strong>chicken came first</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      So philosophy can twist the question in different ways. But science gives us a strong answer.
    </p>

    <h3>✅ Final Answer:</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <strong>Egg came first.</strong><br>
      Because the <strong>first chicken</strong> was born <em>from an egg</em> laid by <strong>non-chickens</strong>.
